This is a primitive 3D renderer created using C++ and the Vulkan API. It is capable of loading .obj files with textures (1 texture per .obj).
This was a high school project created for learning purposes. Before delving into this, I had no experience in C++ or Vulkan. As such, much of the code is derived from external resources.

These resources influenced the development of this project the most, though others were also used:
- [Brendan Galea's Vulkan Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9U9IE0gVHA&list=PL8327DO66nu9qYVKLDmdLW_84-yE4auCR): for learning how to structure a basic Vulkan renderer in C++.
- [Vulkan Tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/): for getting started learning Vulkan.
- Of course, Vulkan's [documentation](https://docs.vulkan.org/spec/latest/index.html) and [specification](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/)

This project is no longer being worked on. The main branch contains unfinished code that I have decided to leave as-is if ever I decide to work on this again, and so it probably won't even run. If you'd like to run the project, clone the v1.0.0 branch, as that is the latest working version, and make sure you have all the dependencies listed in the .env.cmake file.
